## Install

    sudo snap install distrobox

You need to either install docker or podman on your system. While the snap version of docker is functional with Distrobox, it can't access files in your HOME directory.

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/distrobox)

([Don't have snapd installed?](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install))

Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snapcrafters-reboot/24625)) are working to land snap install documentation and the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml) upstream so Distrobox can authoritatively publish future releases.

  - [x] Click the green "Use this template" button above to create a new repository based on this template
  - [x] Give the newly created repository a sensible name, like `godzilla` if you're snapping the Godzilla software (*Note: Do not use `snap` in this name.*)
  - [x] Update the description of the repository to `Unofficial snap for Distrobox`
  - [x] Update logos and references to `Project` and `[my-snap-name]`
  - [x] Create a snap that runs in `devmode`

  - [ ] Fix all important issues found during testing
  - [ ] Make a post in the Snapcraft Forum ["store-requests" category](https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/store-requests/19) asking for a transfer of the snap name from you to Snapcrafters - [link]()
  - [ ] Ask a [Snapcrafters admin](https://github.com/orgs/snapcrafters/people?query=%20role%3Aowner) to fork your repo into github.com/snapcrafters, and configure the repo for automatic publishing into edge on commit
